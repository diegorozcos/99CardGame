# 99 Card Game

This console-based game simulates the cards game, called 99

# How it works
You will be prompted with 4 inputs with the names of the players.  

After that, a random card will be put down to start the game, and a hand of 3 cards will be dealt to each player.  

Now, each player selects which card to play.  

Each player has 4 lives. When someone loses a life, the card will be reset and a new round will start.
